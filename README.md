## This is a fun Movie Search project using The Movie Database API v3

### This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is responsively designed with media queries for layout and responsive text-size scaling for a pleasant experience on all modern screen sizes.

Future improvements:
* refactor PopularList and DataList as separate components
* write adequate unit and integration tests
* implement memoization (cache) of data queries

To start, in the project directory, run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser if it does not open automatically.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
